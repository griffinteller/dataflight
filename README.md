### Usage

Fly around using WASD, Space, and Shift. Click to rotate the camera. Any numerical csv data can be loaded, and then axis can be assigned to different features using the visualizations options panel. 

### Building

Currently, CMakeLists is set up to build for Windows and Linux out of the box. macOS should be supported, but this will take extra work given macOS's inability to play nicely with OpenGL.
